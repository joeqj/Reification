# Reification

A web based interactive project three.js

## Documentation

This project was my first initial plunge into WebGL and advanced Javascript as a whole. I really jumped in the deep end with this project and the end result was quite basic as it was built from modifying examples on the three.js website.

I started working on this around June/July 2016 and it was coded entirely in the front room of Darwen House in Todmorden. I spent days frustrated at the shitty desk, often stoned and listening to tunes whilst trying to build elements that were inline with the aesthetic and general concept.

This was finished and released alongside the Thought Process album and it featured the final track of the album.
